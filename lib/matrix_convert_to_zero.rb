# Updates the input matrix based on the following rules:
# Assumption/ Given: All numbers in the matrix are 0s or 1s
# If any number is found to be 0, the method updates all the numbers in the
# corresponding row as well as the corresponding column to be 0.

  # two methods; one to collect the rows and columns and a second to fill those rows and colums in the matrix_convert_to_0

  # you could also build the new matrix at the same time, but it would have very similar space and time complexity
